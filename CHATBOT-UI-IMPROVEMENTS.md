## How to Pull These Changes

Since you requested not to directly push to your repository, I've created a git bundle file that contains all the changes. Here's how you can pull these changes:

1. Copy the `chatbot-ui-improvements.bundle` file to your local repository
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Add the bundle as a remote
git remote add chatbot-ui-bundle /path/to/chatbot-ui-improvements.bundle

# Fetch the changes
git fetch chatbot-ui-bundle

# Create a new branch from the bundle
git checkout -b chatbot-ui-improvements chatbot-ui-bundle/chatbot-ui-improvements

# Review the changes
git log -p chatbot-ui-improvements

# If you're satisfied, merge the changes to your main branch
git checkout main
git merge chatbot-ui-improvements
```

## Testing
After pulling the changes, you can test the chatbot by:

1. Starting the backend server:
```bash
cd apps/backend
python main.py
```

2. Starting the frontend server:
```bash
cd apps/fe
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Note
These changes maintain all the existing functionality while improving the visual design and user experience. The chatbot now looks more professional and is easier to use.
