# Milestone 2 Features Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the features implemented as part of Milestone 2 for the Vogo.Family AI-Powered Chatbot project. Milestone 2 focused on implementing key components from the main test scenario, enhancing the chatbot's ability to handle location-based queries, service recommendations, scheduling, and human operator handoff.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Location-Based Services
- **Geolocation Detection**: Added capability to detect user's location using browser geolocation API
- **Location-Based Recommendations**: Implemented logic to recommend auto services based on user's location
- **Service Listing**: Enhanced service listing with location information and website links

### 2. Conversation Flow Management
- **Stateful Conversations**: Added conversation state tracking to maintain context throughout the interaction
- **Contextual Responses**: Implemented dynamic responses based on conversation history
- **Multi-Step Interactions**: Support for multi-step flows (e.g., scheduling an appointment)

### 3. Scheduling System
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Added complete appointment scheduling flow
- **Date Parsing**: Implemented natural language date parsing (today, tomorrow, next week, etc.)
- **Time Selection**: Added time slot selection functionality
- **Calendar Integration**: Simulated calendar integration with appointment confirmation

### 4. Human Operator Handoff
- **Human Takeover**: Implemented the ability to transfer complex conversations to human operators
- **Operator Interface**: Added visual indicators when a human operator takes over
- **Ticket Creation**: Simulated ticket creation in a CRM system for human follow-up

### 5. Enhanced User Interface
- **Dynamic Quick Responses**: Context-aware quick response suggestions that change based on conversation state
- **Typing Indicators**: Visual feedback when the chatbot is processing a response
- **Status Notifications**: Clear notifications about actions taken (e.g., calendar additions, human handoff)
- **Avatar Changes**: Visual indicator showing whether user is speaking with AI or human operator

### 6. Backend Enhancements
- **Improved RAG Engine**: Enhanced the Retrieval-Augmented Generation engine to handle more complex queries
- **Conversation State Management**: Backend support for maintaining conversation state
- **API Endpoints**: Added new endpoints for calendar integration, email notifications, and operator requests

### 7. Main Scenario Support
The implementation now supports the following steps from the main test scenario:
1. User can access the AI NLP Powered ChatBot
2. User can ask for auto service in their location via text message
3. Chatbot can ask about the user's issue
4. User can specify brake problems
5. Chatbot provides services located near the user's location with links
6. User can request scheduling
7. Chatbot asks for date and time preferences
8. Chatbot confirms appointment scheduling
9. Simulated actions:
   - Adding to user calendar
   - Sending email to reservations@vogo.family
   - Adding a ticket to the ticketing system
   - Manual takeover by a human operator

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend (Next.js with React)
- Enhanced `ChatContainer.tsx` with conversation state management
- Added geolocation functionality
- Implemented dynamic UI elements based on conversation state
- Added human operator mode with visual indicators

### Backend (FastAPI)
- Enhanced `main.py` with new API endpoints for calendar, email, and operator requests
- Updated request/response models to support location data and conversation state
